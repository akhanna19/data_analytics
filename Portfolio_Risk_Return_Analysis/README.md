## Usage

1) We start by collecting historical data for four fund portfolios - Soros Fund Management, Paulson & Co., Tiger Global Management, & Berkshire Hathaway - and for S&P 500 Market Index. We have these data in a CSV file from which we'll import the data to Pandas dataframe.

2) We then go to the next phase. We calculate and plot the daily returns of the four fund portfolios and S&P 500 Market Index. We also calculate and plot the cumulative returns of the four fund portfolios and S&P 500 Market Index.

3) We then analyze the volatility, risk, and risk-return profile the four fund portfolios and S&P 500 Market Index.

4) Finally, we pick two portfolios and evaluate how the portfolios react relative to the broader market to determine which to recommend for portfolio diversification purposes.
